# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to predict loan approval for applicants based on various features and data. The primary objective is to assist financial institutions in making more informed lending decisions.

## Data
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **person_age**
- **person_income**
- **person_home_ownership**
- **person_emp_length**
- **loan_intent**
- **loan_grade**
- **loan_amnt**
- **loan_int_rate**
- **loan_status**
- **loan_percent_income**
- **cb_person_default_on_file**
- **cb_person_cred_hist_length**

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing pipeline includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, filling null values, and scaling the dataset.

## Model Evaluation
For the production model, **LogisticRegression** is used to predict loan approval.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the following libraries and frameworks:
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
- **imbalanced-learn (imblearn)**
